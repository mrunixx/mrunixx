# hi ðŸ‘‹, i'm manan

I'm a second year comp sci student looking to broaden my skills and explore various industries in tech. Currently, I have been very interested in producing usable web applications which provide some value or assistance
anyone in anyway. 

## current project
I just finished working on [notcookedyet](https://notcookedyet.vercel.app). notcookedyet is a web application aimed to assist graduates and university students succeed and acheive their employment goals. I aim to create a place
where students can create a resume with the assistance they need so that they have a bit less to concentrate on during this competitive time of their life.

Now, I am working on developing my skills in both frontend and backend development by creating a clone for a popular no code database web application called AirTable. By using the T3 stack, creating a clone and providing the core 
functionality of the application, I'm gaining some valuable experience. Visit the clone at [airtable-clone](https://airtable-clone-steel.vercel.app/).

## hobbies & interests
I love configuring my own workspace for productivity, and have delved into a lot of shell scripting and different linux distrobutions. I also love playing some badminton or volleyball at various social comps around sydney.
